# Why We Chose Redis Over TanStack Query for Caching

## Executive Summary
After evaluating different caching strategies, we selected **Redis** because it offers unmatched performance, persistence, and scalability for our project's needs.  
While **TanStack Query** excels at managing client-side data caching within the browser session, it is limited by data loss on refresh and scope confined to individual users.  
**Redis**, on the other hand, provides a robust, system-wide caching solution with persistence, enabling high availability and scalability essential for backend and multi-user environments.

| Feature           | Redis                                | TanStack Query                       |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Location**      | Server-side / External service       | In-browser (client-side only)        |
| **Performance**   | Sub-millisecond latency, shared across apps | Millisecond latency, per user session |
| **Persistence**   | Data survives server restarts        | Data lost on page refresh (default)  |
| **Scalability**   | Horizontal scaling and clustering    | Limited to individual browser session|
| **Use Case**      | Backend/API/data caching & storage   | Frontend UI state & query management |

## Why Redis?

1. **Scalability & Speed**  
   Handles millions of requests per second with minimal latency, ensuring fast data access for large-scale applications.

2. **Cross-Session Persistence**  
   Cached data remains available even after server restarts, ensuring reliability and consistency.

3. **Shared Access**  
   Redis cache is accessible across multiple applications and users, unlike client-side caches limited to individual sessions.

4. **Backend Load Reduction**  
   Significantly minimizes database hits by serving data directly from in-memory, improving overall system performance.

5. **High Availability**  
   Supports clustering, replication, and automatic failover to maintain uptime and resilience.

## Conclusion

- If you need **frontend-focused caching** for smooth UI updates and query deduplication within user sessions, **TanStack Query** is an excellent choice.

- If your use case demands **system-wide, persistent, and highly scalable caching**, especially across multiple users and application components, **Redis is the clear winner**.

Our architecture benefits from Redis by enabling faster data delivery, reducing backend database load, and providing a reliable cache layer for all users and services.
